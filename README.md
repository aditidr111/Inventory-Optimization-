# Inventory-Optimization using Linear Programming

This repository contains Inventory Optimization project for a Fashion and Beauty startup. The dataset is based on the supply chain of Makeup products and is taken from Kaggle. The key features in the dataset includes:  
Product Type, SKU, Price, Availability, Number of products sold, Revenue generated, Customer demographics, Stock levels, Lead times, Order quantities, Shipping times, Shipping carriers, Shipping costs, Supplier name, Location, Lead time, Production volumes, Manufacturing lead time, Manufacturing costs, Inspection results, Defect rates, Transportation modes, Routes, Costs.

## Goal
To optimize inventory levels across different locations (e.g., warehouses) such that:  
    1. Holding costs are minimized  
    2. Stockouts are avoided  
    3. Inventory turnover improves  
    4. Production and transportation constraints are taken into     consideration
